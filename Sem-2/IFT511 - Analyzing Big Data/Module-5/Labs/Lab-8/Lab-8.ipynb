    "4) If no, what does this tell you about the classification performance of the KNN classifier?  \n",
    "\n",
    "    This KNN classifier is overfitting to the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the model’s ability to generalize. The KNN classifier is performing better on the training set than on the test set, which is a common sign of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "    It’s also worth noting that KNN classifiers are especially prone to overfitting due to their reliance on local data points: in high-dimensional spaces, data points are often “far away” from each other, which can lead to overfitting. To improve the model, you could try adjusting the parameters, using feature selection to reduce the dimensionality, or using regularization techniques. It’s also important to ensure that the training data is representative of the data the model will encounter in production."
